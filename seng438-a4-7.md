# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

The effectiveness of the DataUtilities test suite was originally 85%. This was very high, which was a big indicator to us that we had achieved an effective creation of our test case.

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

Equivalent mutants are mutants that have no semantic effect on the overall functionality of the code. Because of this, equivalent mutants appear to be an indicator of a fault with the code, when in reality this is untrue. Because of these equivalent mutants, it is basically impossible to achieve 100% mutation coverage. Therefore, it can be said that equivalent mutants have a negative overall effect on mutation score accuracy in a program under test.

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
