# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class

As can be seen in picture above there is 10 mutants of getCentralValue where the first four mutants survive and the last six mutants are killed. The first four survive as this.lower/this.upper are incremented/decremented after they are used in the return statement, so it does not affect what the function returns, and as such will not cause a test case to fail. The the last six mutants are killed as they cause what the function returns to change, so they result in test cases failing.

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

The effectiveness of the DataUtilities test suite was originally 85%. This was very high, which was a big indicator to us that we had achieved an effective creation of our test case.

The effectiveness of the Range test suite was originally 61%. This was quite mediocre, which was an indicaton that although our test had achieved high statement and branch coverage, it did not thoroughly test all possible inputs. 

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

Equivalent mutants are mutants that have no semantic effect on the overall functionality of the code. Because of this, equivalent mutants appear to be an indicator of a fault with the code, when in reality this is untrue. Because of these equivalent mutants, it is basically impossible to achieve 100% mutation coverage. Therefore, it can be said that equivalent mutants have a negative overall effect on mutation score accuracy in a program under test.

__Equivalent Mutants in DataUtilities:__

DataUtilities (Line 104): for (int i = 0; i < source.length; i++) { ------> for (int i = 0; i != source.length; i++) {<br>
DataUtilities (Line 178): for (int c = 0; c < columnCount; c++) { ------> for (int c = 0; c != columnCount; c++) {<br>
DataUtilities (Line 245): for (int i = 0; i < l1; i++) { ------> for (int i = 0; i != l1; i++) {

__Equivalent Mutants in Range:__ 

Range (Line 19): return ++this.upper - this.lower; --> return this.upper - --this.lower;
Range (Line 430): if (!(this.lower == range.lower)) { --> if ((this.lower != range.lower)) { 
Range (Line 433): if (!(this.upper == range.upper)) { --> if ((this.upper != range.upper)) { 

__How we found equivalent mutations:__

To find equivalent mutations, we looked at the PITEST summary of the files. We checked for all the mutations that survived, because equivalent mutations cannot be killed, as they mimic the correct functionality of the program. When looking at these surviving mutations, we checked the conditions and if they seemed to be equivalent, we tested this functionality manually by changing the code itself (we then changed it back afterwards for consistency).
